Retail Management System (RMS)

Educational Project — built for learning purposes only (not production-ready).

A simple Retail/POS backend (ASP.NET Core .NET 8 + EF Core + SQL Server) and frontend (React + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query). It covers core retail flows: authentication/roles, products & inventory, discounts/coupons, orders/POS, customers, and basic auditing.

⚠️ Educational Use Only

This code is intentionally simplified. It may omit production-grade security, validation, error handling, data protection, and operational hardening. Do not use in real stores or with real customer/payment data.
